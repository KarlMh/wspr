Hide encrypted messages inside ordinary images using steganography. No servers. No accounts. No traces.

Built for journalists, activists, and anyone who needs private communication that doesn't look like private communication.

## How it works

1. Load any PNG image
2. Type your message and set a key (password or keyfile)
3. The message is AES-256 encrypted then hidden inside the image pixels
4. Share the image anywhere — it looks completely normal
5. Recipient loads the image, enters the key, message is revealed

## Security features

- **AES-256-GCM encryption** — military grade
- **LSB steganography** — hidden in pixel data, invisible to the naked eye
- **Temporal keys** — messages expire after ~2 hours automatically
- **Keyfile support** — use any file as a key instead of a password
- **Deniability layer** — embed a decoy message revealed with a different key
- **EXIF stripping** — camera metadata scrubbed from every output image
- **Auto-clear** — session wipes after 5 minutes of inactivity
- **Panic clear** — press ESC twice to instantly wipe everything
- **No server** — everything runs in your browser, nothing is uploaded anywhere
